    "lyrics": "I'm tired of being what you want me to be,\nFeeling so faithless\nLost under the surface,\nDon't know what you're expecting of me,\nPut under the pressure of walking in your shoes\n[Caught in the undertow, Just caught in the undertow]\nEvery step that I take is another mistake to you,\n[Caught in the undertow, Just caught in the undertow]\n\nI've become so numb\nI can't feel you there,\nI've become so tired\nSo much more aware,\nI'm becoming this\nAll I want to do,\nIs be more like me\nAnd be less like you,\n\nCan't you see that you're smothering me?\nHolding too tightly\nafraid to lose control,\n'Cause everything that you thought I would be,\nHas fallen apart\nright in front of you,\n[Caught in the undertow, Just caught in the undertow]\nEvery step that I take is another mistake to you,\n[Caught in the undertow, Just caught in the undertow]\nAnd every second I waste is more than I can take,\n\nI've become so numb\nI can't feel you there,\nI've become so tired\nSo much more aware,\nI'm becoming this\nAll I want to do,\nIs be more like me\nAnd be less like you,\n\nAnd I know I may end up failing too\nBut I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you,\n\nI've become so numb\nI can't feel you there,\nI've become so tired\nSo much more aware,\nI'm becoming this\nAll I want to do,\nIs be more like me\nAnd be less like you,\n\nI've become so numb\nI can't feel you there,\nI'm tired of being what you want me to be,\nI've become so numb\nI can't feel you there,\nI'm tired of being what you want me to be"

    "lyrics": "I walk a lonely road\nThe only one that I have ever known\nDon't know where it goes\nBut it's home to me and I walk alone\n\nI walk this empty street\nOn the Boulevard of Broken Dreams\nWhere the city sleeps\nand I'm the only one and I walk alone\n\nI walk alone\nI walk alone\n\nI walk alone\nI walk a...\n\nMy shadow's the only one that walks beside me\nMy shallow heart's the only thing that's beating\nSometimes I wish someone out there will find me\n'Til then I walk alone\n\nAh-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah,\nAh-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah\n\nI'm walking down the line\nThat divides me somewhere in my mind\nOn the border line\nOf the edge and where I walk alone\n\nRead between the lines\nWhat's fucked up and everything's alright\nCheck my vital signs\nTo know I'm still alive and I walk alone\n\nI walk alone\nI walk alone\n\nI walk alone\nI walk a...\n\nMy shadow's the only one that walks beside me\nMy shallow heart's the only thing that's beating\nSometimes I wish someone out there will find me\n'Til then I walk alone\n\nAh-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah\nAh-ah, Ah-ah\n\nI walk alone\nI walk a...\n\nI walk this empty street\nOn the Boulevard of Broken Dreams\nWhere the city sleeps\nAnd I'm the only one and I walk a...\n\nMy shadow's the only one that walks beside me\nMy shallow heart's the only thing that's beating\nSometimes I wish someone out there will find me\n'Til then I walk alone..."
